  2048 - In each round of the game, two tiles with the number "2" appear. By pressing the arrow keys, you must move them in a certain direction, while the tiles of the same "value" merge together. A player wins by reaching 2048 points. A successful matchup earns points based on the value of the tiles. When there are no moves left and your actions become impossible, a pop-up window will inform you that the game is over.
